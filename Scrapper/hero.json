He had spent his entire life in the service of the Omniscience, the All Seeing One. Theirs was a holy struggle, and so embedded was he in his duty that he never questioned it so long as he had the strength to fight and the impetuous valor that comes with youth. But over the long years of the crusade, as his elders passed away and were buried in sorry graves at the side of muddy tracks, as his bond-brothers fell in battle to uncouth creatures that refused to bow to the Omniscience, as his own squires were chewed away by ambush and plague and bad water, he began to question the meaning of his vows--the meaning of the whole crusade. After deep meditation, he parted ways with his army and commenced a long trek back to the cave-riddled cliffs of Emauracus, and there he set a challenge to the priests of the Omniscience. No knight had ever questioned them before, and they tried to throw him into the pit of sacrifice, but Purist would not be moved. For as he faced them down, he began to glow with a holy light, and they saw that the Omniscience had chosen to reveal Itself to him. The Elder Hierophant led him on a journey of weeks down into the deepest chamber, the holy of holies, where waited not some abstract concept of wisdom and insight, not some carved relic requiring an injection of imagination to believe in, but the old one itself. It had not merely dwelt in those rocks for billions of aeons; no, It had created them. The Omniscience had formed the immense mineral shell of the planet around itself, as a defense against the numerous terrors of space. Thus the All Seeing One claimed to have created the world, and given the other truths revealed to Purist on that day, the knight had no reason to refute the story. Perhaps the Omniscience is a liar, deep in its prison of stone, and not the world's creator at all, but Omniknight never again questioned his faith. His campaign had meaning at last. And there can be no question that the glorious powers that imbue him, and give his companions such strength in battle, are real beyond any doubt.","abilities":[{"cooldown":["10"],"lore":"Priests of the Omniscience are adept at removing impurities from fellow warriors.","name":"Purification","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/omniknight_purification_hp2.png","mana":["100","120","140","160"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/m-oBmTTH_D8?hd=1&rel=0","dynamic":{"Heal/damage":["90","180","270","360"],"Ability":"Unit Target","Radius":["225","225","225","225"],"Damage":"Pure","Affects":"Allied Units"},"index":0,"description":"Instantly heals a friendly unit and damages all nearby enemy units."},{"cooldown":["14"],"lore":"When faced with the pit of sacrifice, Purist's resilience to magic was tested and affirmed.","name":"Repel","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/omniknight_repel_hp2.png","mana":["50","50","50","50"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4B0U8hgXhRY?hd=1&rel=0","dynamic":{"Duration":["6","8","10","12"],"Ability":"Unit Target","Affects":"Heroes"},"index":1,"description":"Creates a powerful divine ward that blocks most magic from affecting a target unit."},{"lore":"The holy embodiment of Purist Thunderwrath is enough to weaken those of lesser faith.","name":"Degen Aura","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/omniknight_degen_aura_hp2.png","videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQR5hhwtS0o?hd=1&rel=0","dynamic":{"Ability":"Passive, Aura","Radius":["315","315","315","315"],"Move/attack slow":["7%","14%","21%","28%"],"Affects":"Enemies"},"index":2,"description":"Greatly degenerates the movement and attack capabilities of enemy units that stray too near."},{"cooldown":["150"],"lore":"The All Seeing One casts down his protection over those that Purist calls friend.","name":"Guardian Angel","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/omniknight_guardian_angel_hp2.png","mana":["125","175","250"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LAgsYrdh5zc?hd=1&rel=0","dynamic":{"Health regen":["25","25","25"],"Duration":["5","6","7"],"Radius":["600","600","600"],"Ability":"No Target"},"index":3,"description":"Omniknight summons a Guardian Angel that grants immunity from physical damage and greatly increases hit point regeneration of nearby allies."}],"agi":"15","intGain":"1.80","ms":"305","primary":"Strength","range":"128","attack":"31 - 41","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Omniknight/","str":"20","int":"17","sight":"1800 / 800","roles":["Durable","Lane Support","Support"],"missileSpeed":"N/A","amour":"4.1","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/omniknight_full.png","hp":"530"},{"agiGain":"2.40","attackMode":"Ranged","name":"Huskar","strGain":"2.40","bio":"Emerging from the throes of the sacred Nothl Realm, Huskar opened his eyes to see the prodigal shadow priest Dazzle working a deep incantation over him.

For centaurs, combat is the perfect articulation of thought, the highest expression of self.  If killing is an art among centaurs, then Bradwarden the Warrunner is their greatest artist.  He rose to dominance on the proving grounds of Omexe, an ancient arena where centaur clans have for millennia gathered to perform their gladiatorial rites.  As his fame spread, spectators came from far and wide to see the great centaur in action.  Always the first to step into the arena, and the last to leave, he composes a masterpiece in each guttering spray, each thrust of blood-slickened blade-length.

He rubbed his back as his eyes drifted shut, and saw a blanket of flowers floating on the placid waves of Augury Bay before exploding into a cloud of pollen that silenced lives as it seized the lungs.  He woke with a choking start.  For hours the rhythmic sound of a whetstone filled the shop as he sharpened a set of massive blades, his mind filled with images of strangling vines garroting neighbors, enwrapping homes.

When the city fell, Rizzrack fled trees that walked, and fought, and killed.  Trees had shattered the gates and swarmed into the city.  Trees had crushed and thrashed and stomped the last that Augury Bay could muster in defense, and stalked the few fleeing refugees.

For them, the quiet of spear fishing, and a family meal were all that a full life required. Yet war came for them nonetheless. Joining the able-bodied conscripts as they filed passed their homes, the humble lancer Azwraith vowed to bring peace to his kingdom, and in so doing, his people. Placed with his kin in the vanguard of the final assault against the Dread Magus Vorn, the cost to his fellows was absolute. As the charging force battled toward the fortress, Azwraith alone among his kind remained standing, and he alone was able to infiltrate the keep. Focused and infuriated by the slaughter of his brothers, Azwraith bested each of the wizard's deadly traps and conjured guardians. Soon the simple fisherman arrived at Vorn's tower sanctum. The pair dueled through the night, pike to staff, as chaos raged below, and with a deafening cry Azwraith pierced his enemy. But the wizard did not simply expire; he exploded into uncountable shards of light, penetrating his killer with power. As the dust settled and the smoke of combat began to clear, Azwraith found himself standing among a throng of his kin. Each seemed to be dressed as he was, each seemed armed as he was, and he could sense that each thought as he did. Aware that his allies were approaching, he willed these phantoms to hide themselves, and one by one they began to vanish into nothingness. As the soldiers came upon the sanctum, they found the warrior that had bested the wizard. When they approached their champion, the lancer vanished.

But in addition to a few trinkets and his considerable pension, the erstwhile engineer left with something far more interesting: a long-forgotten, incomplete schematic for a Gyrocopter, the world's first manned, non-magical flying device. Retiring to the tropical obscurity of the Ash Archipelago with little else but time and money, he set to work building the device. As the years wore on and the remains of failed prototypes began to pile up, he began to wonder if mechanical flight was even possible. A decade and a day after his retirement, on a sunny afternoon with a southerly breeze, Aurel sat in his latest attempt bristling with indignation and expectant failure. With a grunt of effort he pulled the ignition cord and covered his head, waiting for the inevitable explosion. However to his great surprise he began to lift and, following a few panicked adjustments, stabilize. Within an hour, he was ducking and weaving with the breeze, level with the gulls, and Aurel found himself filled with the breathless wonder of flight. As dusk settled in he set a course back to his workshop, but no sooner had he turned his craft when a cannonball tore through his tailfin. Disentangling himself from the wreckage, he swam toward the nearest piece of land in sight, and cursed to see the ship responsible for the cannonball collecting the debris.

As he grasped his trust, Sylla felt his years recede and his vitality returned. Vast knowledge burst into his mind.

Once a key investigator of natural law, Boush the Tinker led a vast intellectual investigation into the workings of nature, founding a subterranean laboratory in the rumored, mist-wreathed wastes of the Violet Plateau. While scorning mages for the dangers they visit upon the world, Boush and his Tinker associates haughtily wrenched open a portal to some realm beyond comprehension and ushered in some nightmares of their own. A black mist rose from the cavernous interior of the Violet Plateau, shrouding it in permanent darkness from which sounds of horror perpetually emanate. Boush escaped with only his wits and the contraptions he carried, the sole Tinker to survive the Violet Plateau Incident.","abilities":[{"cooldown":["14"],"lore":"Boush perfected this rock cutting laser in his subterranean laboratory, never considering its combat utility.","name":"Laser","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/tinker_laser_hp2.png","mana":["95","120","145","170"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2tDx6grjLns?hd=1&rel=0","dynamic":{"Miss rate":["100%","100%","100%","100%"],"Ability":"Unit Target","Damage":["80","160","240","320"],"Affects":"Enemy Units"},"index":0,"description":"Fires an intense energy beam, dealing damage and blinding the target for 3 seconds, causing it to miss all physical attacks."},{"cooldown":["25"],"lore":"The last contraption Boush was able to save was a retrofitted rocket launcher with a homing mechanism.","name":"Heat-Seeking Missile","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/tinker_heat_seeking_missile_hp2.png","mana":["120","140","160","180"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/jK4Sn_EDBpE?hd=1&rel=0","dynamic":{"Targets":["2","2","2","2"],"Ability":"No Target","Damage":["100","175","250","325"]},"index":1,"description":"Launches a pair of rockets at the nearest visible enemy heroes within 2500 range."},{"cooldown":["35"],"lore":"Even though the laboratory has since been sealed off, the ability to radio in robotic drones is still in working order.","name":"March of the Machines","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/tinker_march_of_the_machines_hp2.png","mana":["145","150","165","190"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/AmXRvkaYhIE?hd=1&rel=0","dynamic":{"Duration":["6","6","6","6"],"Radius":["900","900","900","900"],"Ability":"Point Target","Damage":["16","24","32","40"]},"index":2,"description":"Enlists an army of robotic minions to destroy enemy units in an area around Tinker."},{"cooldown":["0"],"lore":"A new battery here, another set of rockets there, Boush continually improves on existing technology.","name":"Rearm","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/tinker_rearm_hp2.png","mana":["150","250","350"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/eHlwkFnGtzs?hd=1&rel=0","dynamic":{"Time to rearm":["3","2","1"],"Ability":"No Target, Channeled"},"index":3,"description":"CHANNELED - Resets the cooldown on most of Tinker's items and abilities."}],"agi":"13","intGain":"2.20","ms":"305","primary":"Intelligence","range":"500","attack":"22 - 28","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Tinker/","str":"17","int":"27","sight":"1800 / 800","roles":["Nuker","Pusher"],"missileSpeed":"900","amour":"3.82","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/tinker_full.png","hp":"473"},{"agiGain":"1.90","attackMode":"Ranged","name":"Nature's Prophet","strGain":"1.80","bio":"When Verodicia, Goddess of the Woods, had finished filling in the green places, having planted the coiled-up spirit in the seed, having lured the twining waters from deep within the rock, having sworn the sun its full attention to the growing things, she realized that her own time had reached its end, and like one of the leaves whose fate she had imprinted in the seed, she would fall without seeing the fruiting of her dream.

No longer willing to pay homage and fealty, they instead sent six-thousand swords into the capital, where they were wiped out in the Massacre of the Apostates. And then came the teeth behind the old truth: When you strike a king's neck, you had better take his head. Enraged by the betrayal, the king exterminated the vast Ambry bloodline, sparing only the lord of the house and his youngest son, Banehallow. Before all the royal court, with the disgraced lord chained to the ornate marble floor, the King bade his magicians transform the boy into a wolf so that he might tear out his own father's throat. \"Do this,\" the king said, \"so that Lord Ambry will understand the bite of betrayal.\" Powerful magic was invoked, and the child was transformed. But though his body was changed, his spirit remained intact, and instead of biting the exposed neck of his father, he attacked his handlers, tearing them to pieces. A dozen of the King's knights perished under the wolf's teeth before they managed to drive it off into the night. Lord Ambry laughed from his chains even as the King ran him through with a sword.

Ages ago, an Herbalist named Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj by coracle, searching for potent essences that might be extracted from bark and root, and found instead a nightmare transformation. Two leagues into Jidi's jungle, Lesale encountered a reptile camouflaged as an epiphyte, which stung him as he mistakenly plucked it. In desperation, he used his partial knowledge of the jungle's herbal bounty, mixing the venom of the (swiftly throttled) reptile with the nectar of an armored orchid, to compound an antidote. In the moments before a black paralysis claimed him completely, he injected himself by orchid-thorn, and instantly fell into a coma. Seventeen years later, something stirred in the spot where he had fallen, throwing off the years' accumulation of humus: Venomancer. Lesale the Herbalist no longer-but Lesale the Deathbringer. His mind was all but erased, and his flesh had been consumed and replaced by a new type of matter-one fusing the venom of the reptile with the poisonous integument of the orchid. Jidi's Acid Jungles knew a new master, one before whom even the most vicious predators soon learned to bow or burrow for their lives. The lurid isle proved too confining, and some human hunger deep in the heart of the Venomancer drove Lesale out in search of new poisons-and new deaths to bring.","abilities":[{"cooldown":["22"],"lore":"A concoction of various stings, poisons, and toxins gathered from the jungles of Jidi Isle, victims surviving it are rare.","name":"Venomous Gale","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/venomancer_venomous_gale_hp2.png","mana":["125"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VAdpuxwCqJU?hd=1&rel=0","dynamic":{"Duration":["15","15","15","15"],"Ability":"Point Target","Damage over time":["15","30","45","60"],"Damage":"Magical","Slow":["50%","50%","50%","50%"],"Strike damage":["25","50","75","100"]},"index":0,"description":"Launches a ball of venom in a line, poisoning enemy units so that they take both initial damage and damage over time, as well as suffering slowed movement.

After millennia of maternal peace, Black Arachnia found herself beset by a steady trickle of furfeet and cutpurses, bold knights and noble youths--all of them delicious, certainly, and yet tending to create a less than nurturing environment for her innocent offspring. Tiring of the intrusions, she paid a visit to Ptholopthales; and when he proved unwilling to discuss a compromise, she wrapped the Vizier in silk and set him aside to be the centerpiece of a special birthday feast. Unfortunately, the absence of the Magnetic Ziggurat's master merely emboldened a new generation of intruders. When one of her newborns was trodden underfoot by a clumsy adventurer, she reached the end of her silken rope.

From the moment of their master's death, the regents of the temple began rites of divination to identify their master's reincarnation, and eventually all signs converged on the immediate neighborhood. Several villages squatted in the shadow of the temple, their alleys and plazas full of the laughter of squalling children.  Pugna, a mere thirteen months of age, was but one candidate among the local brats, and on the appointed day he was presented at the temple alongside two other promising tots. The lamas offered a jumble of worn relics to the children, treasured possessions of their former grandmaster. One boy reached for a porphyry wand that had belonged to the lama...and put it in his nostril. An impish girl pulled out an amulet that had also been the lama's, and immediately swallowed it. Pugna regarded the other two coolly, gave a merry laugh, and blasted them with gouts of emerald flame, reducing them to ashes in an instant. He then snatched up the wand and amulet, saying 'Mine!' The regents hoisted the beaming Pugna on their shoulders, wrapped him in their grandmaster's vestments, and rushed him to the throne before his mood could change.

It required no technology, no wands or appurtenances other than the mind of the magician. All the trappings of ritual were merely mnemonic devices, meant to allow the practitioner to recall in rich detail the specific mental formulae that unlocked a spell's power. The greatest mages in those days were the ones blessed with the greatest memories, and yet so complex were the invocations that all wizards were forced to specialize. The most devoted might hope in a lifetime to have adequate recollection of three spells--four at most. Ordinary wizards were content to know two, and it was not uncommon for a village mage to know only one--with even that requiring him to consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness on the rare occasions when he might be called to use it. But among these early practitioners there was one exception, a genius of vast intellect and prodigious memory who came to be known as the Invoker. In his youth, the precocious wizard mastered not four, not five, not even seven incantations: He could command no fewer than ten spells, and cast them instantly. Many more he learned but found useless, and would practice once then purge from his mind forever, to make room for more practical invocations. One such spell was the Sempiternal Cantrap--a longevity spell of such power that those who cast it in the world's first days are among us still (unless they have been crushed to atoms). Most of these quasi-immortals live quietly, afraid to admit their secret: But Invoker is not one to keep his gifts hidden. He is ancient, learned beyond all others, and his mind somehow still has space to contain an immense sense of his own worth...as well as the Invocations with which he amuses himself through the long slow twilight of the world's dying days.","abilities":[{"lore":null,"name":"Quas","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/invoker_quas_hp2.png","dynamic":{"Ability":"No Target","Hp regen per instance":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7"],"Bonus strength":["2","4","6","8","10","12","14"]},"index":0,"description":"Allows manipulation of ice elements and grants a permanent strength bonus.

The Shadow Demon, however, has always taken a deep and abiding interest in the material plane, as if sensing that mastery of this gritty dimensional nexus might be the key to total domination of all realities. Summoned first by minor wizards, the Shadow Demon granted every wish and put on increasingly impressive displays of power until he had the full attention of the greatest demonologists, and through them the various lords, tyrants, autarchs and heirophants who depended on sorcery to buttress their mundane power. So great was his deception that all his summoners considered themselves the master and Shadow Demon the servant; meanwhile, he eroded their identities and made their minds his own. In the end, most members of the cult were hollow puppets, extensions of his evil will. What Shadow Demon's next step would have been remains open to speculation, for around this time, Nevermore the Shadow Fiend bit into a particularly nasty-tasting soul and discovered that it held nothing but a foul nougat of Shadow Demon's essence. Alerted that a coup was underway, and that the ancient equilibrium of the Umbral Pact was about to be destabilized, Doom Bringer and Shadow Fiend briefly joined forces to destroy the burgeoning cult. Combining spells of incredible force, they undid Shadow Demon's centuries of patient work, reducing his cult to smithereens--and all its members to a bloody splatter. Nothing remained except a tiny speck of demon shadow. Immortal and irreducible, this mote of evil was enough to seed the Shadow Demon's next scheme, and in fits and starts, over further centuries, he began to regroup. Whatever that speck of shadow touched, it tainted, and its influence gradually grew. A chaos of damaged parts pulled together, reknit, and combined to give Shadow Demon a form even stronger than his former. He is all but complete now, and his plan for infinite dominion lacks all of its former weaknesses. It would seem that such a being of pure malice and malevolence, a threat to all creation, would be forever out of place in our world...yet Shadow Demon does not lack for followers.","abilities":[{"cooldown":["25","22","19","16"],"lore":"The pain of deception comes not while it happens, but when it is revealed.","name":"Disruption","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/shadow_demon_disruption_hp2.png","mana":["120","120","120","120"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/W2-DkeB2RiE?hd=1&rel=0","dynamic":{"Illusion damage":["30%","40%","50%","60%"],"Illusion duration":["5","6","7","8"],"Ability":"Unit Target","Illusion bonus damage taken":["50%","50%","50%","50%"],"Banish duration":["2.5","2.5","2.5","2.5"]},"index":0,"description":"Banishes the targeted unit, removing it from play for the duration.
