He had spent his entire life in the service of the Omniscience, the All Seeing One. Theirs was a holy struggle, and so embedded was he in his duty that he never questioned it so long as he had the strength to fight and the impetuous valor that comes with youth. But over the long years of the crusade, as his elders passed away and were buried in sorry graves at the side of muddy tracks, as his bond-brothers fell in battle to uncouth creatures that refused to bow to the Omniscience, as his own squires were chewed away by ambush and plague and bad water, he began to question the meaning of his vows--the meaning of the whole crusade. After deep meditation, he parted ways with his army and commenced a long trek back to the cave-riddled cliffs of Emauracus, and there he set a challenge to the priests of the Omniscience. No knight had ever questioned them before, and they tried to throw him into the pit of sacrifice, but Purist would not be moved. For as he faced them down, he began to glow with a holy light, and they saw that the Omniscience had chosen to reveal Itself to him. The Elder Hierophant led him on a journey of weeks down into the deepest chamber, the holy of holies, where waited not some abstract concept of wisdom and insight, not some carved relic requiring an injection of imagination to believe in, but the old one itself. It had not merely dwelt in those rocks for billions of aeons; no, It had created them. The Omniscience had formed the immense mineral shell of the planet around itself, as a defense against the numerous terrors of space. Thus the All Seeing One claimed to have created the world, and given the other truths revealed to Purist on that day, the knight had no reason to refute the story. Perhaps the Omniscience is a liar, deep in its prison of stone, and not the world's creator at all, but Omniknight never again questioned his faith. His campaign had meaning at last. And there can be no question that the glorious powers that imbue him, and give his companions such strength in battle, are real beyond any doubt.","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Omniknight/","roles":["Durable","Lane Support","Support"],"str":"20","int":"17","intGain":"1.80","missileSpeed":"N/A","agi":"15","agiGain":"1.75","hp":"530","attack":"31 - 41","name":"Omniknight","amour":"4.1","ms":"305","attackMode":"Melee","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/omniknight_full.png"},{"sight":"1800 / 800","abilities":[{"description":"Unlocks the regenerative power of a friendly unit, with healing based upon its primary attribute.

For them, the quiet of spear fishing, and a family meal were all that a full life required. Yet war came for them nonetheless. Joining the able-bodied conscripts as they filed passed their homes, the humble lancer Azwraith vowed to bring peace to his kingdom, and in so doing, his people. Placed with his kin in the vanguard of the final assault against the Dread Magus Vorn, the cost to his fellows was absolute. As the charging force battled toward the fortress, Azwraith alone among his kind remained standing, and he alone was able to infiltrate the keep. Focused and infuriated by the slaughter of his brothers, Azwraith bested each of the wizard's deadly traps and conjured guardians. Soon the simple fisherman arrived at Vorn's tower sanctum. The pair dueled through the night, pike to staff, as chaos raged below, and with a deafening cry Azwraith pierced his enemy. But the wizard did not simply expire; he exploded into uncountable shards of light, penetrating his killer with power. As the dust settled and the smoke of combat began to clear, Azwraith found himself standing among a throng of his kin. Each seemed to be dressed as he was, each seemed armed as he was, and he could sense that each thought as he did. Aware that his allies were approaching, he willed these phantoms to hide themselves, and one by one they began to vanish into nothingness. As the soldiers came upon the sanctum, they found the warrior that had bested the wizard. When they approached their champion, the lancer vanished. The pikeman who had stood before them was no more than another phantom.","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Phantom_Lancer/","roles":["Carry","Escape","Pusher"],"str":"18","int":"21","intGain":"2.00","missileSpeed":"N/A","agi":"23","agiGain":"4.20","hp":"492","attack":"22 - 44","name":"Phantom Lancer","amour":"3.22","ms":"290","attackMode":"Melee","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/phantom_lancer_full.png"},{"sight":"1800 / 800","abilities":[{"description":"Fires a magic missile at an enemy unit, stunning and dealing damage.","mana":["110","120","130","140"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/v0QcCg9lEzU?hd=1&rel=0","cooldown":["10.0"],"imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/vengefulspirit_magic_missile_hp2.png","dynamic":{"Ability":"Target Unit","Damage":["100","175","250","325"],"Duration":["1.45","1.55","1.65","1.75"],"Affects":"Enemy Heroes"},"name":"Magic Missile","lore":"A simple Skywrath technique, the magic missile is Shendel's primary tool for vengeance."},{"description":"Vengeful Spirit lets loose a wicked cry, weakening the armor of enemies and giving vision of the path.","mana":["40","40","40","40"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/M-40xlCUWac?hd=1&rel=0","cooldown":["15.0"],"imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/vengefulspirit_wave_of_terror_hp2.png","dynamic":{"Ability":"Target Point","Armor reduction":["2","3","4","5"],"Damage":["18.75","37.5","56.25","75"],"Vision duration":["3","3","3","3"],"Debuff duration":["20","20","20","20"]},"name":"Wave of Terror","lore":"Shendel's haunting voice hints at her approaching vindication."},{"description":"Vengeful Spirit's presence increases nearby friendly units' physical damage.","videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/313ljmCbIiQ?hd=1&rel=0","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/vengefulspirit_command_aura_hp2.png","dynamic":{"Ability":"Passive, Aura","Radius":"900","Affects":"Allies","Damage bonus":["12%","20%","28%","36%"]},"name":"Vengeance Aura","lore":"Although they may not share her undying passion for revenge, allies do draw on her fanaticism in combat."},{"description":"Instantaneously swaps positions with a target Hero, friend or enemy.

Still others believe he was a lowly street urchin raised among a guild of cutpurses and thieves, trained in the arts of stealth and misdirection.

And that it was he who ended the career of Soruq the Hunter, condemned as a criminal for killing the Prince's prized hellkite.

But in addition to a few trinkets and his considerable pension, the erstwhile engineer left with something far more interesting: a long-forgotten, incomplete schematic for a Gyrocopter, the world's first manned, non-magical flying device. Retiring to the tropical obscurity of the Ash Archipelago with little else but time and money, he set to work building the device. As the years wore on and the remains of failed prototypes began to pile up, he began to wonder if mechanical flight was even possible. A decade and a day after his retirement, on a sunny afternoon with a southerly breeze, Aurel sat in his latest attempt bristling with indignation and expectant failure. With a grunt of effort he pulled the ignition cord and covered his head, waiting for the inevitable explosion. However to his great surprise he began to lift and, following a few panicked adjustments, stabilize. Within an hour, he was ducking and weaving with the breeze, level with the gulls, and Aurel found himself filled with the breathless wonder of flight. As dusk settled in he set a course back to his workshop, but no sooner had he turned his craft when a cannonball tore through his tailfin. Disentangling himself from the wreckage, he swam toward the nearest piece of land in sight, and cursed to see the ship responsible for the cannonball collecting the debris. Days later, when Aurel returned to his workshop, he set to work on yet another gyrocopter, this one capable of carrying a much heavier, more dangerous payload.","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Gyrocopter/","roles":["Disabler","Initiator","Nuker"],"str":"18","int":"23","intGain":"2.10","missileSpeed":"3000","agi":"24","agiGain":"2.80","hp":"492","attack":"17 - 27","name":"Gyrocopter","amour":"4.36","ms":"315","attackMode":"Ranged","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/gyrocopter_full.png"},{"sight":"1800 / 800","abilities":[{"description":"Summons a powerful Spirit Bear companion that can equip items.

As he grasped his trust, Sylla felt his years recede and his vitality returned. Vast knowledge burst into his mind. He found himself able to project his very will into reality and, with some concentration, alter his own physical form as well. Yet subtle whispers and cruel ears brought word of the Seed and its power to other peoples, and a terrible war crashed upon the Bear Clan. As his ancestral home burned, Sylla took his burden and fled to the wild places. Ages passed, and time and myth forgot the Bear Clan, forgot Sylla and the Seed, forgot wondrous civilizations that rose and fell in Bear Clan's wake. For millenia Sylla has waited, waited for word from his deities, waited for peace to come to the ever warring realms, waited in exile and in secret for the end of all things and for the conclusion of his sacred commitment, preparing himself always to face and destroy whatever would dare threaten his purpose.","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Lone_Druid/","roles":["Carry","Durable","Pusher","Jungler"],"str":"17","int":"13","intGain":"1.40","missileSpeed":"900","agi":"24","agiGain":"2.70","hp":"473","attack":"22 - 26","name":"Lone Druid","amour":"3.36","ms":"315","attackMode":"Ranged","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/lone_druid_full.png"},{"sight":"1800 / 800","abilities":[{"description":"Creates three images of Naga Siren under her control.","mana":["70","80","90","100"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/v70MJ69BXHc?hd=1&rel=0","cooldown":["40.0"],"imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/naga_siren_mirror_image_hp2.png","dynamic":{"Ability":"No Target","Bonus incoming damage":["500%","400%","300%","200%"],"Duration":["30","30","30","30"],"Illusion damage":["30%","35%","40%","45%"]},"name":"Mirror Image","lore":"Slithice, while being strong in her own right, is notoriously hard to track down."},{"description":"Interrupts the target and traps them in place, preventing movement or blinking.","mana":["75","85","95","105"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/EmB60RoN_Do?hd=1&rel=0","cooldown":["14.0"],"imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/naga_siren_ensnare_hp2.png","dynamic":{"Ability":"Target Unit","Duration":["2","3","4","5"],"Affects":"Enemy Heroes"},"name":"Ensnare","lore":"The only way to escape the onslaught of a Slithereen is to never oppose one in the first place."},{"description":"The Naga Siren and her images hit all nearby units with a damaging wave of water that lowers armor for 8 seconds.","mana":["80","90","100","110"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kOUYkdJzR0E?hd=1&rel=0","cooldown":["19.0","16.0","13.0","10.0"],"imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/naga_siren_rip_tide_hp2.png","dynamic":{"Ability":"No Target","Armor reduction":["2","3","4","5"],"Damage":["130","160","190","220"]},"name":"Rip Tide","lore":"A torrent from the Deep Ones crushes the defenses of the Siren's enemies."},{"description":"All enemies in range of the Naga Siren are put into a magical stasis where they cannot act or be attacked.

No longer willing to pay homage and fealty, they instead sent six-thousand swords into the capital, where they were wiped out in the Massacre of the Apostates. And then came the teeth behind the old truth: When you strike a king's neck, you had better take his head. Enraged by the betrayal, the king exterminated the vast Ambry bloodline, sparing only the lord of the house and his youngest son, Banehallow. Before all the royal court, with the disgraced lord chained to the ornate marble floor, the King bade his magicians transform the boy into a wolf so that he might tear out his own father's throat. \"Do this,\" the king said, \"so that Lord Ambry will understand the bite of betrayal.\" Powerful magic was invoked, and the child was transformed. But though his body was changed, his spirit remained intact, and instead of biting the exposed neck of his father, he attacked his handlers, tearing them to pieces. A dozen of the King's knights perished under the wolf's teeth before they managed to drive it off into the night. Lord Ambry laughed from his chains even as the King ran him through with a sword. Now the heir to the lost house of Ambry, Banehallow wanders the trail as the Lycan, part warrior, part wolf, in search of justice for all that he lost.","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Lycanthrope/","roles":["Carry","Jungler","Pusher","Durable"],"str":"22","int":"15","intGain":"1.55","missileSpeed":"N/A","agi":"16","agiGain":"1.90","hp":"568","attack":"31 - 36","name":"Lycanthrope","amour":"1.24","ms":"305","attackMode":"Melee","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/lycan_full.png"},{"sight":"1800 / 800","abilities":[{"description":"Throws a mysterious bolt of energy at the target unit.

Yet even in this toxic menagerie, Venomancer is acknowledged as the most venomous. Ages ago, an Herbalist named Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj by coracle, searching for potent essences that might be extracted from bark and root, and found instead a nightmare transformation. Two leagues into Jidi's jungle, Lesale encountered a reptile camouflaged as an epiphyte, which stung him as he mistakenly plucked it. In desperation, he used his partial knowledge of the jungle's herbal bounty, mixing the venom of the (swiftly throttled) reptile with the nectar of an armored orchid, to compound an antidote. In the moments before a black paralysis claimed him completely, he injected himself by orchid-thorn, and instantly fell into a coma. Seventeen years later, something stirred in the spot where he had fallen, throwing off the years' accumulation of humus: Venomancer. Lesale the Herbalist no longer-but Lesale the Deathbringer. His mind was all but erased, and his flesh had been consumed and replaced by a new type of matter-one fusing the venom of the reptile with the poisonous integument of the orchid. Jidi's Acid Jungles knew a new master, one before whom even the most vicious predators soon learned to bow or burrow for their lives. The lurid isle proved too confining, and some human hunger deep in the heart of the Venomancer drove Lesale out in search of new poisons-and new deaths to bring.","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Venomancer/","roles":["Support","Nuker","Initiator","Pusher"],"str":"18","int":"15","intGain":"1.75","missileSpeed":"900","agi":"22","agiGain":"2.60","hp":"492","attack":"24 - 26","name":"Venomancer","amour":"3.08","ms":"290","attackMode":"Ranged","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/venomancer_full.png"},{"sight":"1800 / 800","abilities":[{"description":"Rushes to a target location while slowing the movement and attack speed of all enemies along its path for 3 seconds.","mana":["120","120","120","120"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/S0rGy8SU5wM?hd=1&rel=0","cooldown":["19.0","17.0","15.0","13.0"],"imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/faceless_void_time_walk_hp2.png","dynamic":{"Ability":"Target Point","Range":["700","900","1100","1300"],"Slow":["25%","30%","35%","40%"]},"name":"Time Walk","lore":"Darkterror tears a hole in time, passing through Claszureme, and appearing back in an instant."},{"description":"Faceless Void dodges damage by jumping backward in time, eluding both physical and magical attacks.","videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CUVqXuRDxOc?hd=1&rel=0","imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/faceless_void_backtrack_hp2.png","dynamic":{"Ability":"Passive","Dodge chance":["10%","15%","20%","25%"]},"name":"Backtrack","lore":"Darkterror sees what has yet to be seen."},{"description":"Adds the chance for an attack to lock an enemy unit in time, stunning it and dealing bonus damage.

He only fell for a year or so before an outcrop snagged him. There he rested, dead but undecaying, until the geomancer Anhil thought to verify the legend of the supposedly bottomless Black Pool. Anhil's plumbline snarled with the ropes that bound the drowned magician, and up he hauled an unexpected prize. Thinking that by rendering the dead undead, he could question the Lich about the properties of the pool, he removed the bindings and commenced a simple rite of resurrection. Even the descendants of Ethreain's enemies were long forgotten by time, so there were none to warn Anhil against imprudence.

From the moment of their master's death, the regents of the temple began rites of divination to identify their master's reincarnation, and eventually all signs converged on the immediate neighborhood. Several villages squatted in the shadow of the temple, their alleys and plazas full of the laughter of squalling children.  Pugna, a mere thirteen months of age, was but one candidate among the local brats, and on the appointed day he was presented at the temple alongside two other promising tots. The lamas offered a jumble of worn relics to the children, treasured possessions of their former grandmaster. One boy reached for a porphyry wand that had belonged to the lama...and put it in his nostril. An impish girl pulled out an amulet that had also been the lama's, and immediately swallowed it. Pugna regarded the other two coolly, gave a merry laugh, and blasted them with gouts of emerald flame, reducing them to ashes in an instant. He then snatched up the wand and amulet, saying 'Mine!' The regents hoisted the beaming Pugna on their shoulders, wrapped him in their grandmaster's vestments, and rushed him to the throne before his mood could change. Within five years, the temple itself was another pile of ash, which pleased Pugna to no end.","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Pugna/","roles":["Nuker","Pusher","Support"],"str":"17","int":"26","intGain":"4.00","missileSpeed":"900","agi":"16","agiGain":"1.00","hp":"473","attack":"19 - 27","name":"Pugna","amour":"1.24","ms":"320","attackMode":"Ranged","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/pugna_full.png"},{"sight":"1800 / 800","abilities":[{"description":"Casts a poisonous spell on an enemy unit, causing damage and slowness over time, and eventual paralysis.

It required no technology, no wands or appurtenances other than the mind of the magician. All the trappings of ritual were merely mnemonic devices, meant to allow the practitioner to recall in rich detail the specific mental formulae that unlocked a spell's power. The greatest mages in those days were the ones blessed with the greatest memories, and yet so complex were the invocations that all wizards were forced to specialize. The most devoted might hope in a lifetime to have adequate recollection of three spells--four at most. Ordinary wizards were content to know two, and it was not uncommon for a village mage to know only one--with even that requiring him to consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness on the rare occasions when he might be called to use it. But among these early practitioners there was one exception, a genius of vast intellect and prodigious memory who came to be known as the Invoker. In his youth, the precocious wizard mastered not four, not five, not even seven incantations: He could command no fewer than ten spells, and cast them instantly. Many more he learned but found useless, and would practice once then purge from his mind forever, to make room for more practical invocations. One such spell was the Sempiternal Cantrap--a longevity spell of such power that those who cast it in the world's first days are among us still (unless they have been crushed to atoms). Most of these quasi-immortals live quietly, afraid to admit their secret: But Invoker is not one to keep his gifts hidden. He is ancient, learned beyond all others, and his mind somehow still has space to contain an immense sense of his own worth...as well as the Invocations with which he amuses himself through the long slow twilight of the world's dying days.","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Invoker/","roles":["Carry","Nuker","Initiator","Escape"],"str":"19","int":"22","intGain":"2.50","missileSpeed":"900","agi":"20","agiGain":"1.90","hp":"511","attack":"13 - 19","name":"Invoker","amour":"1.8","ms":"280","attackMode":"Ranged","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/invoker_full.png"},{"sight":"1800 / 800","abilities":[{"description":"Adds extra pure damage to Outworld Destroyer's attacks, based on his remaining mana pool.

The Shadow Demon, however, has always taken a deep and abiding interest in the material plane, as if sensing that mastery of this gritty dimensional nexus might be the key to total domination of all realities. Summoned first by minor wizards, the Shadow Demon granted every wish and put on increasingly impressive displays of power until he had the full attention of the greatest demonologists, and through them the various lords, tyrants, autarchs and heirophants who depended on sorcery to buttress their mundane power. So great was his deception that all his summoners considered themselves the master and Shadow Demon the servant; meanwhile, he eroded their identities and made their minds his own. In the end, most members of the cult were hollow puppets, extensions of his evil will. What Shadow Demon's next step would have been remains open to speculation, for around this time, Nevermore the Shadow Fiend bit into a particularly nasty-tasting soul and discovered that it held nothing but a foul nougat of Shadow Demon's essence. Alerted that a coup was underway, and that the ancient equilibrium of the Umbral Pact was about to be destabilized, Doom Bringer and Shadow Fiend briefly joined forces to destroy the burgeoning cult. Combining spells of incredible force, they undid Shadow Demon's centuries of patient work, reducing his cult to smithereens--and all its members to a bloody splatter. Nothing remained except a tiny speck of demon shadow. Immortal and irreducible, this mote of evil was enough to seed the Shadow Demon's next scheme, and in fits and starts, over further centuries, he began to regroup. Whatever that speck of shadow touched, it tainted, and its influence gradually grew. A chaos of damaged parts pulled together, reknit, and combined to give Shadow Demon a form even stronger than his former. He is all but complete now, and his plan for infinite dominion lacks all of its former weaknesses. It would seem that such a being of pure malice and malevolence, a threat to all creation, would be forever out of place in our world...yet Shadow Demon does not lack for followers.","url":"http://www.dota2.com/hero/Shadow_Demon/","roles":["Support","Disabler","Nuker"],"str":"17","int":"26","intGain":"2.70","missileSpeed":"900","agi":"18","agiGain":"2.20","hp":"473","attack":"27 - 31","name":"Shadow Demon","amour":"2.52","ms":"295","attackMode":"Ranged","portraitUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/heroes/shadow_demon_full.png"},{"sight":"1800 / 800","abilities":[{"description":"Visage drains the movement and attack speed of the targeted unit, gaining it for itself.","mana":["70","80","90","100"],"videoUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Wn_IpUEFnOk?hd=1&rel=0","cooldown":["10.0"],"imgUrl":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/visage_grave_chill_hp2.png","dynamic":{"Ability":"Target Unit","Duration":["3","4","5","6"],"Affects":"Enemy Heroes"},"name":"Grave Chill","lore":null},{"description":"Visage damages the targeted unit based on the number of soul charges.
